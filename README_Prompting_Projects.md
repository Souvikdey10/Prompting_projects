# 🧠 Prompt Engineering Project Portfolio

Welcome to my Prompt Engineering portfolio – a curated set of mini-projects that demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 can be leveraged for practical, real-world use cases. Each project showcases my ability to design effective prompts, structure workflows, and build lightweight tools that solve specific problems using AI.
